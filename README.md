**Set up instructions for viewing app:**

There is an Android APK found in the initial directory of this repository. 
This can be added to an Android device, located using an app like [Astro File Manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.metago.astro&hl=en), and then installed. 

The app can also be ran through Ionic, by serving with a CLI from within the ‘IonicFiles’ directory. 
Please note that this app has been made for compiling for Android, and as such the following serve is recommended:

 `ionic serve --platform android`
